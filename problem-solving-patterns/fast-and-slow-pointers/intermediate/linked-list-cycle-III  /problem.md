# Problem: Linked List Cycle III

## Statement

Given the head of a linked list, determine the length of the cycle present in the linked list. If there is no cycle, return `0`.

A cycle exists in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

---

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10,000:
- −100,000 ≤ Node.val ≤ 100,000
