# Problem: Find The Duplicate Number

## Statement

Given an array of positive numbers `nums`, such that the values lie in the range `[1, n]` (inclusive), and there are `n + 1` numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in `nums`.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, but it may appear more than once in the array.

**Note:**

- You **cannot modify** the given array `nums`.
- You must solve the problem using only **constant extra space**.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`
- `nums.length = n + 1`
- `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ n`
- All integers in `nums` are unique, **except for one integer** that appears more than once.
