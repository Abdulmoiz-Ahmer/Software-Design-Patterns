# Functional Design Patterns in JavaScript

Functional design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common programming problems, designed with **functional programming principles** in mind.  
Instead of relying on **classes**, **inheritance**, and **mutable state**, these patterns focus on **pure functions**, **immutability**, and **composition** to write **cleaner**, **easier-to-test**, and **more maintainable** code.

## Why Functional Design Patterns?

Functional programming (FP) is becoming increasingly popular in JavaScript because it:

- Promotes **immutability** and **predictable state management**
- Encourages **composition over inheritance**
- Produces **reusable**, **testable**, and **clean** code
- Reduces side effects by favoring **pure functions**
- Makes code more **declarative** and **readable**
