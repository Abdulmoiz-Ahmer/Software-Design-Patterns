# Adapter Pattern

In this lesson, you will learn about the **adapter pattern** in detail with the help of a coding example.

## What is the Adapter Pattern?

The **adapter pattern** allows classes that have different interfaces (properties/methods of an object) to work together. It **translates the interface** for a class to make it compatible with another class.

This pattern is useful if an API is modified or new implementations are added to it. In such cases, if other parts of a system are still using the old API, the adapter pattern will act as a **bridge** so the two can work together without breaking changes.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like a **plug adapter**: your laptopâ€™s charger might have a US plug, but in Europe you need an adapter so it can fit into the socket. The adapter doesnâ€™t change how your charger works; it just makes it compatible.

## Coding Example

Letâ€™s take a look at a coding example to understand this better.

```javascript
class SimpleEarphones {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Use Earphones with Type C phone");
    };
  }
}

class EarPhoneAdapter extends SimpleEarphones {
  constructor(typeCphone) {
    super();
    this.attach = function () {
      typeCphone.attach();
    };
  }
}

class TypeCPhone {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Earphones attached to Type C phone");
    };
  }
}

var typeCphone = new TypeCPhone();
var adapter = new EarPhoneAdapter(typeCphone);
adapter.attach();
```

In the code above, we want to attach a simple earphone to a type c mobile device. We have a SimpleEarphones class which has a method, attach, defined on it like so:

```javascript
class SimpleEarphones {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Use Earphones with Type C phone");
    };
  }
}
```

Similarly, we have a TypeCPhone class that also has the attach method defined on it like this:

```javascript
class TypeCPhone {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Earphones attached to Type C phone");
    };
  }
}
```

You canâ€™t insert a simple earphone into a type c phone directly, hence, you need an adapter that allows you to connect your earphone to the mobile phone. For this purpose, we have an EarPhoneAdapter class that inherits from the SimpleEarphones class.

```javascript
class EarPhoneAdapter extends SimpleEarphones {
  constructor(typeCphone) {
    super();
    //code...
  }
}
```

The super command initializes the constructor of the SimpleEarphones class.

```javascript
class SimpleEarphones {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Use Earphones with Type C phone");
    };
  }
}

class EarPhoneAdapter extends SimpleEarphones {
  constructor(typeCphone) {
    //super initializing "SimpleEarphones" constructor
    super();
  }
}

class TypeCPhone {
  constructor() {
    this.attach = function () {
      console.log("Earphones attached to Type C phone");
    };
  }
}

var typeCphone = new TypeCPhone();
var adapter = new EarPhoneAdapter(typeCphone);
//Since super initialized "SimpleEarphones" constructor
//its `attach` method will get initialized
//So the command below will display the result from the "SimpleEarphones" attach function
adapter.attach();
```

In our case, we redefine the attach function in the EarPhoneAdapter class as follows:

```javascript
class EarPhoneAdapter extends SimpleEarphones {
  constructor(typeCphone) {
    super();
    this.attach = function () {
      typeCphone.attach();
    };
  }
}
```

Now, the TypeCPhone's attach function is called instead. Hence, the adapter class implements SimpleEarphones and attaches it to the TypeCPhone through the EarPhoneAdapter constructor.

## When to Use the Adapter Pattern?

You should use the adapter pattern when:

- Old APIs need to work with new refactored ones.
- An object needs to cooperate with a class that has an **incompatible interface**.
- You want to **reuse existing functionality** of classes without rewriting them.
