## What are Creational Patterns?

As the name implies, these patterns provide optimized object creation techniques.  
They help address design and complexity issues that might occur when using the basic approach.  
They also help control the creation of objects.

The creational patterns we will cover include:

- **Factory Pattern**
- **Constructor Pattern**
- **Singleton Pattern**
