# What are Architectural Patterns?

As the name implies, these patterns help build an efficient architecture for the application. They provide a set of subsystems with assigned responsibilities that include guidelines on constructing relationships between these subsystems.

## Main Architectural Patterns Covered

We will cover three main architectural patterns:

- **MVC pattern** (Model-View-Controller)
- **MVP pattern** (Model-View-Presenter)
- **MVVM pattern** (Model-View-ViewModel)
